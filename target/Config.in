config BR2_ROOTFS_PREFIX
	string "Custom root fs prefix"
	default "rootfs"
	help
	  Add a custom string to the beginning of the root file system name.

config BR2_ROOTFS_SUFFIX
	string "Custom root fs suffix"
	default ""
	help
	  Add a custom string to the end of the root file system name.

config BR2_ROOTFS_POST_BUILD_SCRIPT
	string "Custom script to run before packing files"
	default ""
	help
	  Specify a script to be run after the build has finished and before
	  the BR2 starts packing the files into selected packages.

	  This gives users the oportunity to do board-specific cleanups,
	  add-ons and the like, so the generated files can be used directly
	  without further processing.

	  The script is called with the target directory name as first and
	  only argument. Make sure the exit code of that script is 0,
	  otherwise make will stop after calling it.
