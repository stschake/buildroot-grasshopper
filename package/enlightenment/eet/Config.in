		Eet is a tiny library designed to write an arbitrary set of chunks of data to a file and optionally compress each chunk
		(very much like a zip file) and allow fast random-access reading of the file later on. It does not do zip as a zip
		itself has more complexity than is needed, and it was much simpler to implement this once here.
